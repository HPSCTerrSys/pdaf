! !ROUTINE: PDAF_get_state_si --- Interface to control ensemble integration
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_get_state_si(nsteps, time, doexit, outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model before the 
! forecast of each ensemble state to transfer data
! from PDAF to the model.
!
! This routine provides the simplified interface
! where names of user-provided subroutines are
! fixed. It simply calls the routine with the
! full interface using pre-defined routine names.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
! should not be changed by the user   !
!

! 2010-07 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log

  IMPLICIT NONE
  
! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(inout) :: nsteps  ! Flag and number of time steps
  REAL, INTENT(out)      :: time    ! current model time
  INTEGER, INTENT(inout) :: doexit  ! Whether to exit from forecasts
  INTEGER, INTENT(inout) :: outflag  ! Status flag

! ! Names of external subroutines

                                        !   of next observation
       distribute_state_pdaf, &         ! Routine to distribute a state vector
